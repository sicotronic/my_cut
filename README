This small program is my own version of the 'cut' unix program, but it is meant to work with csv files, specially with tab-delimited files.
The program is written in the file 'my_cut.py'. Instructions for the usage are giving when '-h' or '--help' are given in the arguments.

There are two input files to test the program called test_input1 and test_input2.
The output files are the results of the following executions:

my_cut.py test_input1.csv 0-3,15/9,8:12,5,6,7 output1.csv

my_cut.py test_input2.csv 0-3,4-1,2,0 output2.csv
